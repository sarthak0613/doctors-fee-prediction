## **--Introduction--**

Welcome to the repository for Doctor's Fee Prediction Machine Learning model! In this repository, I present an innovative solution aimed at predicting medical consultation fees based on various relevant factors. Whether you're a patient, healthcare professional, upcoming doctor or a data enthusiast, this project offers valuable insights into predicting the financial aspect of medical services.

## **--Problem Aimed to Solve--**

This project takes into consideration a number of factors such as Speciality of Doctor, Degree Type, Year of Experience, DP Score, City etc. for predicting the Doctor's fees which certainly helps patients and upcoming doctors to have an idea about it.

## **--Approach--**

![Web Scraping in](https://github.com/sarthak0613/doctors-fee-prediction/assets/135547703/ed915bd9-3006-46a9-8214-51730014e600)

## **--Data Description--**

1. ML Model Files- These files includes the .ipynb Jupyter Notebook files wherein we have developed the Regression model for our project from the data by importing the .csv file that we got after web scraping of the practo.com website. It also contains a .pkl file which is the pickle file of our project.

2. CSV File- The final csv is included in this folder where we have uploaded the csv which we made after web scraping. The csv file contains a table which has columns such as Name, Speciality, Degree of doctor, Years of experience, Location, City, NPV, DP score and Consultation Fee. These are the factors as discussed earlier around which our project runs and predicts the fees.

3. Python Files- This folder contains all the .ipynb Jupyter Notebook files of the doctor's specialisation wise web scraping. Data of each specialisation is being scraped in each of the .ipynb files.

4. Web Page Files- We created a web page using HTML and deployed our ML model into it using flask. This folder contains the main HTML file, app.py file where we have imported flask library of python and deployed our ML model.

5. PPT- We have created an aesthetic presentation for the viewers to have a brief idea on the objective of this model, flow of our project, major insights, etc. PPT file is included in this folder.
